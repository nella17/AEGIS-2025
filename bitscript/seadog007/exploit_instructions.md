# RCE Exploit Instructions

## Vulnerability
String concatenation integer overflow in `eval_binary_operator` at 0x403D2C

## Payload Files
- `poc_rce_payload.bs` - Full exploit attempt (may require large memory)
- `poc_rce_simple.bs` - Simplified version for testing

## How to Run

1. **Basic test:**
```bash
./bitscript poc_rce_simple.bs
```

2. **Full exploit (if you have enough memory):**
```bash
./bitscript poc_rce_payload.bs
```

## Expected Behavior

**If vulnerable:**
- Heap buffer overflow occurs
- Program crashes or executes arbitrary code
- May see segmentation fault or heap corruption errors

**If protected:**
- Program may run out of memory before overflow
- Or may complete without crashing (bounds check working)

## Notes

- The exploit requires building very large strings
- May hit memory limits before triggering overflow
- On systems with sufficient memory, this should cause heap corruption
- Heap exploitation techniques can then be used to achieve RCE

## Alternative Approach

If the direct string concatenation doesn't work due to memory limits, you may need to:
1. Use heap grooming techniques
2. Combine with other vulnerabilities
3. Target specific heap structures
