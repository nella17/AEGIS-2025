# Simplified RCE Payload - Heap Corruption Attempt
# This version uses a loop to build strings more efficiently

# Start with base strings
string s1 = "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA";

# Build up strings using loops
# Note: bitscript doesn't have for loops, so we unroll
# In a real exploit, you'd want to build these as large as possible
